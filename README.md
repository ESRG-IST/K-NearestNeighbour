# K-NearestNeighbour
K Nearest Neighbour Algorithm has been written from scratch using the Data given by Sir

Everyone must study all 3 files.
The first 2 files namely, trainingdata.csv and testdata.csv, are data files.
The three files must be in the same folder so the files are accessible to python.
The last file knn.py is the python script for K-Nearest Neighbour Algorithm.

Anybody who does not understand anything must comment. I shall try my best to explain.
Best Regards
